## âœ… COMPLETED: Backend Implementation

### 1. Environment Finalization: Containerize and Configure Ollama âœ…

The highest priority is to complete the development environment setup as outlined in the `prd.md` and `techstack.md` documents. The goal is to have all services, including the default Ollama LLM, running and communicating within Docker containers.

- [x] **Update docker-compose.yml:** Add a new service definition for Ollama
- [x] **Configure Environment:** Update the `.env` file with the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to point to the Ollama container, as specified in `config/model_config.yaml`
- [x] **Verify Service Communication:** Ensure that the FastAPI application can successfully connect to the Ollama service
- [x] **Pull Ollama Model:** Successfully pulled `qwen3:0.6b` model (optimized for memory constraints)
- [x] **Run Test Script:** Verified setup with `scripts/test-setup.sh` (all tests passed)
- [x] **Optimize Performance:** Disabled `think` traces for cleaner, faster responses

### 2. LLM Integration: Implement the OllamaLLM Client âœ…

With the Ollama service running, the next step is to implement the client that will interact with it.

- [x] **Implement generate Method:** Flesh out the `generate` method in `src/llm/ollama_client.py`. This should include the logic for making API calls to the Ollama service
- [x] **Test with prompt_testing.ipynb:** Use the `notebooks/prompt_testing.ipynb` notebook to test the OllamaLLM client and ensure it is working as expected
- [x] **Performance Optimization:** Implemented `think: false` for Qwen models to disable thinking traces

### 3. Core Feature Development: Note Ingestion âœ…

Begin implementing the core logic for note ingestion, as described in `documentation/dataflow.md`.

- [x] **Create Ingestion Function:** In `src/backend/ingestion.py`, create a function that accepts a note as input
- [x] **Integrate OllamaLLM Client:** Call the OllamaLLM client to process the incoming note for tagging and entity extraction
- [x] **Upsert to Neo4j:** Implement the logic to connect to the Neo4j client and upsert the processed note into the graph database

**Implementation Details:**
- âœ… **Neo4j Client:** Implemented full Neo4j client with connection management, note upserting, and search functionality
- âœ… **NoteIngestionService:** Created comprehensive service that processes notes through LLM for tags, entities, and highlights
- âœ… **API Integration:** Updated FastAPI endpoints to handle note ingestion, retrieval, and search
- âœ… **Error Handling:** Added proper error handling and logging throughout the pipeline
- âœ… **Entity Storage:** Fixed Neo4j entity storage by creating separate nodes for entities

### 4. API Layer: Flesh out the FastAPI Endpoint âœ…

As the note ingestion logic is developed, expose it through the FastAPI backend.

- [x] **Update FastAPI Endpoint:** In `src/backend/api.py`, update the relevant endpoint to handle note submissions and trigger the ingestion process
- [x] **Test with data_pipeline_testing.ipynb:** Use the `notebooks/data_pipeline_testing.ipynb` notebook to test the end-to-end data flow, from API submission to storage in Neo4j

**API Endpoints Implemented:**
- âœ… `POST /notes` - Ingest a single note
- âœ… `POST /notes/batch` - Ingest multiple notes in batch
- âœ… `GET /notes/{note_id}` - Retrieve a specific note
- âœ… `POST /notes/search` - Search notes by content or tags
- âœ… `GET /notes` - List recent notes (placeholder)
- âœ… `GET /health` - Health check with service status

## âœ… COMPLETED: Streamlit Frontend Implementation

### 5. Streamlit Frontend Implementation âœ…

**Priority: HIGH** - This gives us a complete user interface

- [x] **Note Input Interface**: Created a clean Streamlit form for note entry with multiple pages
- [x] **Note Display**: Show ingested notes with tags, entities, and highlights in beautiful cards
- [x] **Search Interface**: Added search functionality with filters and result display
- [x] **Real-time Updates**: Show processing status and results with progress bars
- [x] **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and retry options
- [x] **System Status**: Added comprehensive system monitoring and health checks
- [x] **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with custom CSS styling
- [x] **Navigation**: Multi-page interface with sidebar navigation

**Frontend Features Implemented:**
- âœ… **Home Page**: Welcome screen with quick stats and quick note input
- âœ… **Add Note Page**: Full-featured note creation with title, content, and tags
- âœ… **Search Page**: Advanced search with result filtering and display
- âœ… **System Status Page**: Health monitoring, API endpoints, and troubleshooting
- âœ… **Real-time Processing**: Progress bars and status updates during note processing
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- âœ… **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures and connection issues
